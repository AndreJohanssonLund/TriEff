\title{Print Method for Triage Effectiveness Results}
\usage{
\method{print}{calc_te}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A calc_te object containing:
\itemize{
\item results: Tibble with TE metrics
\item metadata: List with calculation parameters
\item bootstrap_distributions: Optional bootstrap results
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to print (not currently used)}

\description{
Formats and displays triage effectiveness analysis results in a readable format.

confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The output is organized in sections:
\enumerate{
\item Results for each group showing:
\itemize{
\item Total patients and LOSET prevalence
\item Classification metrics (sensitivity, specificity)
\item Triage Effectiveness metrics (OTE, TTE, OTG)
\item Bootstrap variation intervals (if available)
}
\item Computation information including:
\itemize{
\item Calculation method (bootstrap or direct)
\item Number of iterations (if bootstrap)
\item Sample percentage (if bootstrap)
\item Calculation timestamp
}
}
