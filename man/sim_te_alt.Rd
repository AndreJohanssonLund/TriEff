\title{Full Triage Effectiveness Simulation for Research}
\usage{
sim_te_alt(df, tte = TRUE, btte = FALSE, n_workers = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing patient data, including:
\itemize{
\item id: Unique patient identifier
\item arrival_minute: Minutes since start of study period until patient arrival
\item resolve_minute: Minutes since start until patient sees physician
\item priority: Original triage priority
\item priority_binary: Binary priority (typically 1 for high, 2 for low)
\item loset: Logical indicating if patient is time-critical per LOSET criteria
\item observed_wait_time: Actual waiting time in minutes
}}

\item{tte}{Logical. If TRUE, calculates Theoretical Triage Efficacy (TTE). Default is TRUE.}

\item{btte}{Logical. If TRUE, calculates Binary Theoretical Triage Efficacy (BTTE). Default is FALSE.}

\item{n_workers}{Integer. Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original patient data and additional columns:
\itemize{
\item theoretical_wait_time: Simulated wait time based on original priorities (if tte=TRUE)
\item binary_theoretical_wait_time: Simulated wait time based on binary priorities (if btte=TRUE)
}
}
\description{
Performs a complete simulation of emergency department patient flow, calculating
theoretical wait times for all patients regardless of their time-critical status.
This function is designed for research purposes when complete queue behavior analysis
is needed, and is more computationally intensive than the standard sim_te function.
}
\details{
Unlike sim_te which optimizes performance by focusing only on segments containing
time-critical cases, sim_te_alt simulates waiting times for all patients. This makes
it more suitable for research purposes such as:
\itemize{
\item Analyzing complete queue behavior patterns
\item Studying wait time distributions for non-time-critical patients
\item Validating simulation methodology
\item Investigating effects of different priority schemes
}

The simulation operates in a non-preemptive manner, treating physician contacts as
available time slots and processing patients strictly according to priority and
arrival order. While this provides complete information about theoretical queue
behavior, it is computationally more intensive than sim_te and may not be necessary
for standard TE calculations.

Note that while sim_te_alt calculates wait times for all patients, it produces
identical TE values to sim_te since TE metrics depend only on the wait times of
time-critical patients relative to the overall mean.
