\description{
Calculate Triage Effectiveness with Segment Bootstrap
}
\details{
Performs segment-based bootstrap analysis of TE metrics, where entire queue
segments are resampled rather than individual patients. This approach preserves
temporal dependencies and queue dynamics within segments, providing more
statistically valid confidence intervals for time series queue data.

Key differences from standard bootstrapping:
\itemize{
\item Segments (periods where queue goes from 0 to 0) are the resampling unit
\item Temporal patterns and dependencies within segments are preserved
\item More accurately reflects uncertainty in systems with queue dynamics
