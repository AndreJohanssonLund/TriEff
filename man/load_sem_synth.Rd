\title{Synthetic Emergency Department Data from Skåne Emergency Medicine (SEM) Cohort}
\format{
A data frame with 460,986 observations and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{priority}{Factor with 5 levels (1-5) representing triage priority (RETTS system), where 1 is highest priority}
\item{ambulance}{Logical indicating if patient arrived by ambulance}
\item{unit}{Factor with 2 levels representing the treating hospital. "C" that is a larger ED and "E" That is a smaller one.}
\item{chief_complaint}{Factor representing the main reason for ED visit (translated to English and grouped into clinical categories)}
\item{age_at_arrival}{Numeric age of patient at time of arrival}
\item{gender}{Factor with 2 levels: "F" (female), "M" (male)}
\item{discharged_to}{Factor with 5 levels: "Admitted", "Died", "Home", "Moved to other hospital", indicating ED visit outcome}
\item{admitted_to_hospital}{Logical indicating if patient was admitted to hospital}
\item{ward}{Factor indicating type of ward for admitted patients (e.g., "ICU", "Cardiology", "MedSurg", etc.)}
\item{loset}{Logical indicating if case was time-critical according to LOSET criteria}
\item{arrival_at_hospital}{POSIXct timestamp of arrival at hospital}
\item{exit_ed}{POSIXct timestamp of exit from ED}
\item{resolve}{POSIXct timestamp of first physician contact}
\item{arrival}{POSIXct timestamp of triage assessment}
\item{chief_complaint_category}{Factor grouping chief complaints into broader clinical categories}

\description{
A synthetic dataset generated based on statistical properties of ED visits across all eight
hospitals in the Skåne Emergency Medicine (SEM) database from 2017-2018. Generated using
synthpop methodology with complaint-based grouping, this dataset mimics real patterns while
containing no actual patient data.
}
\details{
This synthetic dataset is based on ED visits from 2017 across two hospitals in
the Skåne region of Sweden. It preserves the statistical relationships and patterns of the
original SEM cohort while containing no real patient information. The dataset includes adult
patients (age >= 18) with medical, surgical, or orthopedic complaints.

While the synthetic data maintains similar priority distributions and demographic patterns
as the original, triage effectiveness values are consistently lower (e.g., overall Observed
TE: 39.1\% vs 45.8\% in original). However, relative performance patterns across hospitals
are preserved, making it suitable for testing the TriEff statistical package.

Time variables follow this sequence:
arrival_at_hospital <= arrival (triage) <= resolve (physician) <= exit_ed
}
