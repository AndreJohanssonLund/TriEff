)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing patient data}

\item{distribution}{Priority distribution tibble from \code{extract_triage_distribution()}}

\item{max_distribution_diff}{Maximum allowed difference between target and achieved
distribution. Default is 0.05 (5\%)}

\item{max_tries}{Maximum number of attempts to achieve target distribution. Default is 10}
}
\value{
Data frame with updated priority assignments
}
\description{
Applies a triage priority distribution from one ED to another ED's patient data.
This function reassigns priorities to patients while preserving all other patient
characteristics, allowing assessment of how different triage systems would perform
in different settings.
}
\details{
The function uses an iterative approach to assign priorities:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates target counts for each priority based on the input distribution
\item Randomly assigns priorities to patients according to these targets
\item Adjusts assignments to ensure exact totals match
\item Validates that the achieved distribution is within tolerance
}
}
